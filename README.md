Overview
The AI-Driven Content Moderation System is a robust, scalable platform that automatically detects and mitigates harmful or inappropriate content on social media. Built with a combination of Google Cloudâ€™s AI capabilities and modern web technologies, the system enables real-time moderation of text and images, flagging content such as hate speech, explicit imagery, and harassment.

The platform is designed to integrate directly with social media APIs, allowing business or creator accounts to moderate user comments, flag inappropriate content, and manage responses through an intuitive admin dashboard.
